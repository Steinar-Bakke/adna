**adna** is the *A*synchronous-process *DNA* fastq checker and trimmer


about
-----

The *adna* project was started in 2015 as a senior project at the University of North Dakota, created by Jake Staehle, Brandon Vovk, and Steinar Bakke.

*adna* is an *A*wesome *DNA* utility. It utilizes the OpenMPI library system to provide asynchronous processing of DNA fastq data sets. It supports fasta adapter files for trimming. It merges two reads. It doesn't do much else right now. 

Work in progress.
